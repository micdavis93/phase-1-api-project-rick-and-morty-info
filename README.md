# Rick and Morty Information Website

## Overview 
The Rick and Morty Information Website is being programmed as the Phase 1 project for Flatiron School cohort 103122. The Rick and Morty Information Website is a MVP designed to enable users to both access detailed information on Rick and Morty characters, as well as interact with that information. 

## Objectives + Core Features
The Rick and Morty Information Website will include three distinct event listeners, and include at least two instances of array iteration. The site will pull from the Rick and Morty API in order to populate and render specific character details. The Rick and Morty Information Website is intended to present the following objectives and functionalities:

1. A sortable, searchable list of characters. This search function will utilize the array 'filter' method and include an event listener. The search function will enable the user to find specific characters via an intuitive search bar. 

2. Upon locating a specific character, the user will be able to select that character. This will be made possible by adding a 'click' event listener. 

3. Once a character is selected, its detailed information will be populated via the Rick and Morty API. This detailed information will be rendered via a 'forEach' method, and will include:
    1. Image
    2. Name
    3. Status
    4. Origin
    5. Episode of First Appearance

4. The selected character will be accompanied by a like/dislike function, which will increment appropriately with each user interaction. This functionality will also include a 'click' event listener.

5. The selected character will also be accompanied by a comment section. The user will be able to write a comment and post said comment for other users to view. This comment feature will include a 'submit' event. 

## Potential Challenges
The challenges we currently expect to encounter primarily revolve around simplification. It's incredibly easy to allow creativity and desire to achieve presently unattainable goals to complicate an otherwise uncomplicated project. However, so long as we keep our outlined objectives in mind, we believe we'll be able to streamline this project, meeting the deliverables via clean and concise code.
